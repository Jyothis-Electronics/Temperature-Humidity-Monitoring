## Interfacing nodemcu with DHT11 with cloud integration
This project aims in interfacing esp8266 nodemcu with DHT11 and show the results in in a cloud intefrace.
## Description
The whole idea is based on ESP8266 nodemcu and DHT11 sensor is interfaced to get the measurements. The Wi-Fi capabilities of nodemcu is particularly used to show the output from the sensors to a host.
The working flow is shown in the block diagram.
